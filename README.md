iOS Tip Calculator app

Following video tutorial at:

Diverged slightly, specifically:

  * Targeted iOS 7, which was released yesterday, switching the target to 6.0 in the released
      version of XCode 5 runs into issues because it also wants to target arm64, which I had
      trouble disabling and felt like a distraction.

  * Did not use a dollar-sign in the UI intentionally because I feel it reaches an international
    audience better.

  * Designed the UI to be a bit tighter so that it's all visible and workable with the keyboard up.
